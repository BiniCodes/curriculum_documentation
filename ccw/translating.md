# Translating our Projects

We want to reach as many children across the world as we can, no matter what language they speak. Our volunteers have helped translate our projects into 28 languages, but we have a long way to go before we have a truly global curriculum.

Translating our projects is a great way to support us if you aren't able to start a club of your own yet. No prior tech knowledge is needed to be a translator, and we'll support you with each step of the process.

To express interested in volunteering as a translator, please complete our [translator form](https://docs.google.com/a/raspberrypi.org/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdoxUvmGwbpx3zcCxXwJEqaBoAQHsTu-v5R4uOTSxv9-OzUEw/viewform). We will get in touch with you within a week.

Thank you!
